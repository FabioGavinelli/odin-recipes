# odin-recipe
This project is part of the Odin Project.

The goal is to create a simple recipes websites with links to some recipes in it.

By the end of the project I should be confident in
1. setting up an HTML project the right way
2. use the basic HTML tags to present an homepage with some content in it
3. use links elements and attributes to reference material outside the home page
